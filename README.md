THIS IS AN UNSUPPORTED RESEARCH PROTOTYPE.

A location sharing app example that uses [Backchannel](https://github.com/inkandswitch/backchannel).

## Running locally

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
2. In `Map.tsx`, add Mapbox API key in the line `mapboxgl.accessToken = ''`
3. You need one terminal running `yarn start` for the UI, and another running `yarn relay` for the backend.
